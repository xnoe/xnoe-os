# Xnoe OS

An attempt at writing an "Operating System" in x86 assembler.

Hi all, I have many hobbies, one of those is torturing myself with knowledge I probably won't ever make use of again, and that is why this exists.

I've had an interest in operating systems since I started to code, and *have* attempted to write this in the past, but I lacked the skills required back then.

This codebase features a bootloader that can load files from a FAT16 disk, and a kernel that doesn't have much functionality at all.
